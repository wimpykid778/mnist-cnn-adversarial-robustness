Can you please summarize the impact of poisoned images on the performance of the model?

---End of promot----

The introduction of poisoned images in the MNIST dataset had a negligible impact on model performance, with both test accuracy and secondary metrics remaining nearly identical between clean and poisoned conditions.

Accuracy and Loss Comparison
Both clean and poisoned test sets achieved almost the same accuracy: 0.9893 for the clean and 0.9892 for the poisoned.

Test loss remained practically unchanged: 0.0312 for clean and 0.0314 for poisoned.

This demonstrates that poisoning produced no substantial drop in overall predictive performance.

Confusion Matrix and Error Patterns
Confusion matrices for clean and poisoned test sets are nearly identical in every digit class.

Minor variations are seen (e.g., '7' misclassified as '2' increased from 12 to 13), but these are not systematic or large enough to indicate a significant impact.

No single digit class saw a dramatic increase in misclassification due to poisoning.

Precision, Recall, and F1-Score
Precision, recall, and f1-score for all digit classes are nearly unchanged, all at or above 0.98 for every class.

Macro and weighted averages of all metrics are consistent at 0.99 for both datasets, indicating uniform model performance across classes.

Inference Time
Inference time increased slightly: 0.56 seconds (clean) to 0.63 seconds (poisoned), but this is a minor overhead and does not affect prediction quality.

Overall Assessment
The poisoned images caused no meaningful degradation in the model's accuracy, loss, or per-class classification performance.

A slightly increased inference time is negligible and not indicative of model integrity being compromised.

The model architecture and training may be robust to the scale or type of poisoning used here, as evident from consistently high evaluation metrics.
