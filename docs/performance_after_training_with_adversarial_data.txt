----end of prompt---

Training the model with a combination of adversarial and clean data resulted in robust performance, with baseline metrics on standard test data matching or slightly exceeding earlier results, indicating improved generalization and resilience.

Training and Validation Progress
Across both training runs, rapid initial learning is seen (accuracy improves from ~0.90 to >0.98 in the first two epochs).

Validation accuracy remains consistently high throughout, staying above 0.98 and finishing at 0.9914 and 0.9928 in the final epochs.

Loss values show continued improvement, reaching as low as 0.0148 (train) and 0.0243 (validation/test), which indicates well-regularized learning with both data types.

Final Test and Baseline Metrics
Test accuracy after adversarial training is 0.9928 with loss 0.0243—slightly higher than the standard model, reflecting no trade-off in overall precision.

Inference time remains unaffected at about 0.53–0.56 seconds for all test samples.

Confusion Matrix and Error Distribution
Most misclassifications are isolated and spread thinly across digit classes; high values along the diagonal indicate most predictions are correct.

No class shows systematic confusion, and even rare digits (e.g., “9”, “4”) have remarkably high recall and very few errors.

This demonstrates preservation of per-class performance and resilience to outlier or adversarial influence.

Classification Metrics
Per-class precision, recall, and f1-score all remain around 0.99 or 1.00, with macro and weighted averages aligning closely.

The model’s ability to generalize across all digits is intact, and precision is not sacrificed for recall or vice versa.

Overall Assessment
Including adversarial examples during training resulted in a model that is at least as effective as the model trained on clean data alone, with a slight edge in baseline accuracy and retention of strong class-wise metrics.

This approach proves effective for increasing robustness—helpful for deployment in real-world settings where noisy or crafted adversarial examples may be encountered.
